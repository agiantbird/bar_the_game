# BAR (the game)

**BAR (the game)** is a browser-based, game* adaptation of my novella, **[BAR](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53469610-bar)**.  You control a character in each chapter/scene/game level, and the text of the novella is expressed in dialogue screens and level animations.

\* 'game' is a term being used loosely/generously. There is precious little gameplay in this study and True Gamersâ„¢ won't find much fun here.


# Play

The game is currently hosted on GitHub pages and playable at: https://agiantbird.github.io/bar_the_game/ 

## Controls

**Player Movement:** [ W ][ A ][ S ][ D ] keys, or, arrow keys to move.
**Engage with objects:** Press the [ENTER] key while facing objects/people to engage with them.
**Advance dialogue:** [ENTER] key also will advance dialogue more quickly.
**Pause menu:** Press the [ESC] key to bring up the pause menu where you can look up controls and save your game.


## Saving your game

Bring up the game's pause menu and highlight the 'Save' option. Press enter or click on the Save option and your game will be saved to your browser's local storage. The game's pause menu (and ability to save) can be engaged any time the player has control over a character's movement.

## Loading your game

If you have a save file in your browser's local storage, it can be loaded from the game's initial load screen. Select "Continue book" to load your game.

This project is an interpretation/implementation of the code and style of the 'Pizza Legends RPG' JavaScript game building tutorial series created by Drew Conley and available to [view on youtube](https://youtu.be/fyi4vfbKEeo). This project would not exist without said series and if you are interested in getting started learning game development and/or JavaScript development, I cannot recommend it enough.
